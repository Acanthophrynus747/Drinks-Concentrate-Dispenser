# Drinks Concentrate Dispenser
This is the Arduino c++ code for two microcontrollers to run a machine to pump concentrated drink mix (or any other liquid) in preset recipes when buttons are pushed. One microcontroller receiving the button presses and one running the pumps communicate with a serial connection.

Me and a small team made this machine for our final project, and I did the code. I may adapt the concept into an auto-bartender in the future, seeing as it could easily be used to mix some cocktails from some base ingredients.
